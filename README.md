# RISC-V
# Number Guessing Game in OCaml

This is a simple text-based number guessing game implemented in OCaml. The program, named `Random.ml`, generates a random number between 0 and 99, and the player has to guess the number.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have OCaml installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official website: https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html

2. Save the OCaml code provided in a file named `Random.ml`.

3. Compile the OCaml code using the OCaml compiler. You can use the following command:

   ```sh
   ocamlopt -o guess_number Random.ml

This will generate an executable named guess_number.
Run the executable:
./guess_number
